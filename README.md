# information about the Virtual CV

## Hosting:
the website is hosted on GitHub.io.

## Innovation:
Simple yet effective animation was added to all of the Headings and sub-headings of the website. (hover the mouse over the text to see the effect)
Lighting and animations were also added to all of the buttons located on the website to enhance the presentation.

The website is supposed to have a minimalistic design and feel to it. The animations are there to add a little bit of sparkle without making it too busy or overwhelming.

## Web technologies:
CSS animations were added to the website, and JavaScript was used to create the toggle menu that can only be seen when viewed on a mobile device or format. 

## Compatibility:
This website is fully compatible with all devices with different screen sizes and dimensions. Tested all devices (mobile, tablet, and Windows browser).

## Navigation:
Navigation was made easy by keeping the website linear. It is really simple and easy to navigate through the virtual CV
There are small arrow tabs on the desktop browser version, and you can automatically click on the menu tabs above to go directly to that part of the website.

### Extras:

All of my information can be found on the website (Linkedin, Email and GitHub)
My CV is also accessible and downloadable from the website.

The menu tabs above change to an animated Hamburger menu (simple stacked line design) when viewed on a mobile device or in smaller screen sizes.

I initially designed and tested the website in the html-css-javas-portfolio. After it was completed I added it to this repository.
